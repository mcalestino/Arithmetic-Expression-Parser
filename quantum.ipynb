        "*   The simulation successfully executed a 2D quantum lattice walk for 10 steps using 2 coin qubits and 4 position qubits (2 for x and 2 for y).\n",
        "*   The quantum circuit was constructed by repeatedly applying Hadamard gates to the coin qubits and implementing conditional shift operations on the position registers controlled by the coin state.\n",
        "*   The conditional shift was implemented using simplified quantum incrementer and decrementer functions controlled by the coin qubits, mapping the four coin states (|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>) to shifts in the right, left, up, and down directions, respectively.\n",
        "*   Measurement gates were added to the position registers to capture the final state.\n",
        "*   Simulation on a `qasm_simulator` provided measurement counts for various final quantum states.\n",
        "*   The binary outcomes from the simulation were successfully parsed to extract the final (x, y) positions on the lattice, accounting for Qiskit's qubit ordering and mapping the 0-indexed register values to centered positions around (0,0).\n",
        "*   The probability distribution of the final positions was calculated from the measurement counts and visualized using a scatter plot where marker size indicated probability. The visualization showed a characteristic distribution of probabilities on the 2D lattice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current incrementer/decrementer implementation is simplified; using more optimized quantum arithmetic circuits could improve the efficiency and scalability of the simulation for larger lattices or more steps.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve comparing the probability distribution of the quantum walk to that of a classical random walk for the same number of steps to highlight the differences, such as the faster spreading characteristic of quantum walks.\n"
